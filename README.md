# AvaloniaWeatherTracker
A cross-platform weather tracker app written in C# / Avalonia UI.
---
Uses my self-written REST API to grab weather data: https://github.com/leofox2021/WeatherForecastRestAPI.

Check its Readme.md in order to run it alongside the app. 

Without REST API running you WON'T be able to retreive weather data!
---

The app uses CommunityTookit.Mvvm instead of deafult ReactiveUI for easier MVVM implementation.

---

Right now only the Desktop version functions properly, but I'm working on improving it for other platforms as well.
