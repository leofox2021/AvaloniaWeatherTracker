# AvaloniaWeatherTracker
A cross-platform weather tracker app written in C# / Avalonia UI.
---
Uses my self-written REST API to grab weather data: https://github.com/leofox2021/WeatherForecastRestAPI.

Uses CommunityTookit.Mvvm instead of deafult ReactiveUI for easier MVVM implementation.

---
Right now only the Desktop version functions properly, but I'm working on improving it for other platforms as well.
